# Loopdesk-Habit-Tracker-protoytpe-1
A simple habit tracker prototype built to help users develop and maintain consistent daily habits. The app allows users to define habits, mark them as completed each day, and track progress over time through a clean and intuitive interface.
This project is intended as a prototype, focusing on core functionality, basic state management, and user experience rather than full production features. It serves as a solid foundation for learning, experimentation, or further expansion into a complete habit-tracking solution.
